            <h3>TIME & STYLE AMSTERDAM</h3>
 
            <p>
        Dummy-A long time ago I noticed an andon lamp was lit around the corner of the room at dusk in a Japanese ryokan. Its soft light through Japanese paper washi made me feel relaxed.    
            </p>
            <p>
        As for the top lid of the andon, the cedar grain tells the passage of a long history. When I took off the top lid and looked inside, there was a trace that has been used rapeseed oil and candles since Edo period. The impression of the gentle light through the handmade washi paper still remain in memory. However, andon has left behind from the present life and it has been used only in a tea room and Japanese style inn.      

            </p>
            <p>
         When it comes to Japanese light, there is an image of lantern but andon has been used more often in Japanese living space since Edo era. I have been thinking to get back the light in the modern life space.       

            </p>
            <p>
              However, there is nothing more difficult than replacing some of the old traditions into modern ones. It is necessary to inherit traditional style such as formality, basic methods and materials without deviating the rules. What to preserve, what to throw away, and what to add, I am still exploring how to put it in our daily living space not only in Japan, but in other countries as well.
